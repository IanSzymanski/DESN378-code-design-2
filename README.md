## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
I learned the difference between the declaring with const and let. In general I also learned a bit about how Javascript is formatted.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Trying to figure out why I was getting an error, only to realize it was just me forgetting an apostrophe.
​
​
### How I Used AI
To understand better the firefox web project, I was using AI to explain the purpose and function of each line of code, though no AI was used to actually write code.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Mostly the formatting of differnent symbols and what they mean, like {}=-+><>()
​
​
### Work Completed (Week 0)

**Build**
- [✅ ] The Setup
- [ ✅] The Behavioral Layer
​
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
I learned what a design system was, why it is useful (or not) and how to implement one. I also learned that AI is very helpful for teaching me what specific lines of code do.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Understanding why each line of javascript is necessary took some time. I look forward to spending more time with conditionals to smooth out some of the rough edges.
​
​
### How I Used AI
AI was an integral process of my storyteller process. From directory mistakes to understanding syntax, I used Github Copilot in an interactive way to help me understand the code better.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
When it comes to conditionals, understanding all of the different symbols and their meaning on first glance is the hard part. <>=+- are more simple, but I was exposed to ||, == and === which have very distinct meanings.
​

## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
Javascript reads much like a left to right language, and inserting each element into a point in a sentence helps to understand what is happening. Figma's variables are set up in an interesting way, and I am not sure if I like it yet.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Understanding how my portfolio was transfered into figma was definitely a learning curve. It grouped together individual divs and sections based on their tag, so I had to do some reset work to get it into a more workable state.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used github copilot to break down a complicated (for me) function as a phrase. When referring to -element-, if -this- happens, then -that happens, else -those- happen.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Figmas page variable switching isn't very clear to me, so I need to put time into that.
​
