## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
I learned the difference between the declaring with const and let. In general I also learned a bit about how Javascript is formatted.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Trying to figure out why I was getting an error, only to realize it was just me forgetting an apostrophe.
​
​
### How I Used AI
To understand better the firefox web project, I was using AI to explain the purpose and function of each line of code, though no AI was used to actually write code.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Mostly the formatting of differnent symbols and what they mean, like {}=-+><>()
